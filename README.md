# DELTA V2
## DB(D)  Endpoint(E)  Latency(L)  Testing(T)  Ammeter(A)

Annoucing a new version of DELTA, a tool to calculate Cloud Database endpoint latency using SQL queries. This version is written from scratch to calculate latency more accurately and also to give p99 latency

📌 Introducing DELTA (DB Endpoint Latency Testing Ammeter). DELTA is a tool to test real-world latency against a remote database using execution of a query and calculating the network return time. The tool provides functions to test latency of Oracle, MySQL and Postgres databases.

The tool uses the oracledb, psycopg2 and pymysql packages to connect to the respective databases and execute a single query per request (you can specify multiple requests as well). The tool uses the time module to measure the time it takes to execute the query, fetch the results, and close the connection. It calculates the latency of each request and the average latency of all requests.

🔧 DELTA is a cloud tool to test real-world latency against a remote database endpoint using execution of a query and calculating the network return time. 


🔧 Network tools like ping ,iperf or tcp ping can only give you network based latency which does not always translate well to an application running those queries on a remote database. 


🐍 DELTA uses Python client for Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL to run a query like “SELECT 1” or "SELECT 1 FROM DUAL". You can then specific the number of executions of the query and DELTA calculates the average network round-trip time for all the executions of the query on the remote database. The script also includes error handling to track failed requests. You can also include your own custom queries. 


## How it works
The function 'measure_latency_oracle' uses the oracledb package to connect to the Oracle database and execute a single query per request. The function uses the time module to measure the time it takes to execute the query, fetch the results, and close the connection. The function then calculates the latency of each request and the average latency of all requests. The function opens a new connection for every request and closes it after fetching the results, which will measure the time it takes to execute the query, transfer the data over the network, and close the connection. The query parameter is passed to the function, allowing you to test the performance of the database with different queries. The same logic applies to the functions of mysql and postgres
